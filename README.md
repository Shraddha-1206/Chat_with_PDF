# Chat_with_PDF
 

This project lets you effortlessly upload PDF files and ask context-specific questions about their content.

Powered by **Hugging Face models**, it delivers accurate embeddings and intelligent question-answering capabilities‚Äîtransforming your static documents into dynamic, interactive assistants.

# ‚ú® Key Features

- **üì§ Effortless PDF Upload & Smart Text Extraction**  
Seamlessly upload multiple PDF files and watch as the system extracts and processes their content into manageable chunks for easy analysis.

-   **üîç Intelligent Semantic Search**  
    Harness the power of vector embeddings to pinpoint the most relevant sections of your PDFs, ensuring precise answers to your queries.
    
-   **üí° AI-Powered Question Answering**  
    Get accurate and insightful responses using Hugging Face‚Äôs **`deepset/roberta-base-squad2`** model, designed to provide contextually rich answers.
    
-   **üñ•Ô∏è Interactive Streamlit UI**  
    Enjoy a clean, user-friendly interface to upload PDFs, explore their content, and engage in dynamic conversations‚Äîall in one place.

# Installation Guide

### Prerequisites

Before you get started, ensure you have the following:

1.  **üêç Python 3.8 or higher** ‚Äì Make sure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2.  **üîë Hugging Face API Token** ‚Äì Access to Hugging Face models requires an API token. (Example: `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`)


# Project Structure

A quick breakdown of the key files and directories in this project:

-   **`app.py`** ‚Üí  The main application script that powers the project. Run this to start interacting with your PDFs.
    
-   **`requirements.txt`** ‚Üí  A list of all necessary Python dependencies to set up the environment effortlessly.
    
-   **`README.md`** ‚Üí  Project documentation to guide you through installation, features, and usage.
    
-   **`faiss_index/`** ‚Üí  A directory where the FAISS vector store is dynamically generated and stored at runtime for efficient search and retrieval.

# Technologies Used

This project leverages a powerful tech stack to provide seamless PDF interaction and intelligent Q&A capabilities:

-   ** Streamlit** ‚Äì Powers the interactive and user-friendly web interface for effortless PDF uploads and queries.
    
-   **Hugging Face Transformers** ‚Äì Utilizes the **`deepset/roberta-base-squad2`** model to deliver precise and context-aware answers to your questions.
    
-   **LangChain** ‚Äì Handles text embedding and chunking, enabling efficient processing of document content for better analysis.
    
-   **FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)** ‚Äì Provides high-performance semantic search by storing and retrieving document vectors efficiently.
    
-   **PyPDF2** ‚Äì Extracts text from PDF files with ease, allowing the system to analyze document content accurately.
    
-   **Python-dotenv** ‚Äì Manages environment variables securely to keep sensitive data, such as API keys, safe and accessible.

# How It Works

- **Upload PDFs:** Users upload PDF files, which are processed to extract text.

- **Text Splitting:** The extracted text is divided into smaller chunks for better processing.

- **Vectorization:** Each text chunk is embedded into a vector space using sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2.

- **Semantic Search:** When a question is asked, the system retrieves the most relevant chunks from the vector store.

- **Answer Generation:** The Hugging Face QA pipeline generates a response based on the retrieved context.
